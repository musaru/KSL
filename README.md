# KSL
Dynamic Korean Sign Language Recognition Using Pose Estimation Based and Attention-Based Neural Network"
Thank you very much to  Mr Chen for opening their repository, we inspired by Chen code and thought to update and modifying it "https://github.com/yuxiaochen1103/DG-STA"

## Introduction
Coming soon .....................

## Prerequisites
We implement and run the code in two environment:
GPU Pytorch
Colabrator

I experimented for 
a.KSL dataset at HPE GPU Machine
b.Hirooka PC



## Training
1. KSL-77:"[Automatic mexican sign language recognition using normalized moments and artificial neural networks" https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=71592](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-030-37731-1_43)
2. KSL-Lab-Dataset: Under Processing
